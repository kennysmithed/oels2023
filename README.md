Online Experiments for Language Scientists, semester 1 of the 2023-2024 academic year.

Full content for the course (code walkthroughs etc) in a readable format is at https://kennysmithed.github.io/oels2023/, you can find the markdown source and zipped code on the gh-pages branch. Here you can inspect individual pieces of code, some of which I had to zip up in the webpage version for convenience of the people downloading them.
